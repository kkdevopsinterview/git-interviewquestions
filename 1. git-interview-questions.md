# Git Interview Questions & Answers

## 1. What is GIT?  
GIT is a distributed version control system and source code management (SCM) system with an emphasis to handle small and large projects with speed and efficiency.

## 2. What is Distributed Control System?  
We work in our local machine and later we transfer the code to Centralized repository (GitHub). We don’t need to connect to centralized repository to work.

## 3. What is GIT version control?  
- Allows you to track the history of a collection of files.  
- Supports creating different versions of file collection. Each version captures a snapshot.  
- You can revert to previous versions.  
- VCS allows switching between these versions (stored in a repository).  

## 4. What is difference between SVN and Git?  

| SVN | GIT |
|-----|-----|
| Centralized repository | Distributed repository |
| Requires network connection | Work offline; network only for push/pull |
| Developers directly interact with repo | Developers commit locally, then push to repo |

## 5. What is a repository in GIT?  
A Git repository contains the history of files.

## 6. How can you create a local repository in Git?  
```bash
git init
````

## 7. What is ‘bare repository’ in GIT?

A bare repository just contains version control information and no working files.

```bash
git config --global user.name "user_name"
git config --global user.email "user_email"
```

## 9. How to Create Alias to git commands

```bash
git config --global alias.lo "log --oneline"
git config --global --unset alias.lo
git config --global --unset user.name
```

## 10. What is git clone?

Download an existing repository from GitHub to local.

```bash
git clone <url>
```

## 11. What is ‘git add’?

Add files from working area to staging area.

```bash
git add <file_name>
```

## 12. What is Staging Area?

Holding area before commits, also called Index Area.

## 13. What is the use of ‘git log’?

View commits history.

```bash
git log
git log -5
git log --oneline
git log --author="user_name"
```

## 14. Commit modified files directly

```bash
git commit -a -m "message"
```

## 15. Edit incorrect commit message

```bash
git commit --amend -m "new message"
```

## 16. Reset commit to staging area

```bash
git reset --soft <commit_id>
```

## 17. Reset file from staging to working area

```bash
git reset head <file_name>
```

## 18. Reset commit to working area

```bash
git reset --mixed <commit_id>
```

## 19. What is git reset?

Resets current HEAD to a specific state.

## 20. What is ‘head’ in Git?

A reference to a commit object. Default is **master**.

## 21. What is .gitignore file?

Files listed in `.gitignore` will be skipped during `git add` and `git commit`.

## 22. How to see the difference between 2 commits?

```bash
git diff <commit_id1>..<commit_id2>
```

## 23. Recover deleted file from staging/commit

```bash
git checkout -- <file_name>
```

## 24. How to create a branch?

```bash
git branch <branch_name>
```

## 25. How to checkout to branch?

```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```

## 26. How to create branch while checkout?

```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

## 27. Rename local branch

```bash
git branch -m <old_branch_name> <new_branch_name>
```

## 28. See branch list

```bash
git branch
```

## 29. See remote branch list

```bash
git branch -r
git remote show origin
```

## 30. See local & remote branches

```bash
git branch -a
```

## 31. Delete a branch

```bash
git branch -d <branch_name>
git branch -D <branch_name>
```

## 32. Delete remote branch

```bash
git push origin -d <branch_name>
```

## 33. Difference between 2 branches

```bash
git diff <branch1>..<branch2>
```

## 34. What is git push?

Push commits from local repo to remote repo.

## 35. Push to master branch

```bash
git push   # must be in master branch
```

## 36. Push files to specific branch

```bash
git push origin <branch_name>
git push --set-upstream <branch_name>
```

## 37. Push new branch to remote

```bash
git push <repo_url> <branch_name>
git push --set-upstream <branch_name>
```

## 38. What is git pull?

Downloads and merges branch data from remote to local. Equivalent to `git fetch + git merge`.

## 39. Pull from specific remote branch

```bash
git pull origin <branch_name>
```

## 40. Download branch without merge

```bash
git fetch origin <branch_name>
git checkout <branch_name>
```

## 41. What is git fetch?

Downloads new data from remote repo without merging into working files.

```bash
git fetch <branch_name>
git fetch origin <branch_name>
```

## 42. Difference between git clone & git pull

* `git clone`: Downloads the entire repository.
* `git pull`: Updates existing repo with new changes.

## 43. What is git merge?

Combines two branches.

```bash
git merge <branch_name>
```

## 44. What is git conflict?

Occurs when multiple people edit the same lines in a file across different branches.

## 45. How to resolve merge conflict?

Edit conflicting files, fix manually, then:

```bash
git add <file_name>
git commit
```

## 46. Skip merge conflict

```bash
git merge --abort
```

## 47. What is git rm?

Removes file from working/staging area and disk.

```bash
git rm <file_name>
```

## 48. Check if branch already merged

```bash
git branch --merged
git branch --no-merged
```

## 49. What is branching?

Working on different versions of code independently.

## 50. Criteria to merge branches

* Modules developed in separate branches
* After testing, merge into main branch

## 51. Branching strategies

* **Feature branching**
* **Task branching**
* **Release branching**

## 52. What is git stash?

Temporarily stores uncommitted changes.

```bash
git stash save "message"
git stash list
git stash apply <id>
git stash pop <id>
git stash drop <id>
git stash clear
```

## 53. When to use git stash?

* Switching branches with uncommitted files
* Preventing merge of unwanted files
* Pulling remote changes without merging local files

## 54. Alternative to merge

```bash
git rebase
```

## 55. Difference between merge & rebase

* Merge: Keeps history, adds extra commit
* Rebase: Rewrites history, no extra merge commit

## 56. Undo last commit

```bash
git revert <commit_id>
```

## 57. Change remote URL

```bash
git remote set-url origin <new_url>
```

## 58. What is a Pull Request?

A request to merge changes from one branch into another.

## 59. Why Git is better than SVN?

* Open source
* Works offline
* Distributed workflow
* Tracks authorship

## 60. How to lock a branch in GitHub?

* Go to **Settings → Branches**
* Select branch → Mark as protected

## 61. Delete repository in GitHub

## 62. Give access to a collaborator

* Go to **Settings → Collaborators**
* Add GitHub username → Invite collaborator
* They accept via email → Gain access


Do you want me to also **export this as a `.md` file** and share the download link so you can push it directly, instead of copy-paste?
