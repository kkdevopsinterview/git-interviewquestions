# Git Interview Questions & Answers (KK FUNDA)

## 1. Can you explain your project GitHub structure?
A typical project repo looks like:
```

├── README.md        # Documentation
├── .gitignore       # Ignored files
├── src/             # Source code
├── tests/           # Unit tests
├── scripts/         # Build/Deploy scripts
├── docs/            # Project documentation
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/   # GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines
└── Dockerfile       # Containerization

````
**Why?** → For clarity, CI/CD integration, easy onboarding, and separation of concerns.

---

## 2. Can you explain about Git workflow?
- **Working Directory → Staging Area → Local Repo → Remote Repo**
- Developer flow:
  - `git pull` → work on code → `git add` → `git commit` → `git push`
  - Raise Pull Request → Code Review → Merge

---

## 3. How to remove untracked files from working directory?
```bash
git clean -f       # remove untracked files
git clean -fd      # remove untracked files & directories
````

---

## 4. Is it possible to move files from staging back to working directory?

```bash
git reset HEAD <file>
```

Moves file out of staging but keeps changes in working directory.

---

## 5. Due to a bad commit, application is not working. How to revert it?

* Safe way:

```bash
git revert <commit_id>
```

* To completely discard (dangerous in shared repos):

```bash
git reset --hard <commit_id>
```

---

## 6. Difference between git reset and git revert?

* **reset** → moves HEAD to a previous commit (rewrites history).
* **revert** → creates a new commit that undoes changes.

---

## 7. What is a .gitignore file?

* File that lists patterns for files Git should ignore.
* Example:

```
*.log
node_modules/
.env
```

---

## 8. Can you explain your branching strategy?

* **Feature Branching** → one branch per feature.
* **Release Branching** → frozen branch for release.
* **Task Branching** → one branch per ticket/task.
* **GitFlow Example**:

  * `main` → production-ready code.
  * `develop` → integration branch.
  * `feature/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`.

---

## 9. Can you explain in detail about merge conflict?

* Happens when **two branches edit the same line** differently.
* Steps to resolve:

  1. Edit conflicted files.
  2. Mark resolved with `git add`.
  3. Commit the merge.
* To abort merge:

```bash
git merge --abort
```

---

## 10. What is the difference between branch and tag?

* **Branch** → movable pointer for active development.
* **Tag** → fixed snapshot (usually release version).

---

## 11. What is git stash?

Temporarily stores uncommitted changes.

```bash
git stash save "WIP"
git stash list
git stash apply/pop
git stash drop
```

---

## 12. My local repo size is increasing. How to reduce it?

* Clean up:

```bash
git gc
git prune
```

* Remove large files:

```bash
git filter-repo
```

---

## 13. Git best practices?

* Small, frequent commits with meaningful messages.
* Branch → PR → Review → Merge.
* Protect `main/master`.
* Avoid committing secrets or binaries.

---

## 14. Git clone vs Git fork?

* **Clone** → copy of repo, you need access to push.
* **Fork** → GitHub feature, your own copy under your account.

---

## 15. Fast-Forward Merge vs ORT?

* **Fast-forward** → moves branch pointer forward (no extra commit).
* **ORT (new default in Git 2.34+)** → optimized recursive merge.

---

## 16. Merge vs Rebase?

* **Merge** → preserves history, adds merge commit.
* **Rebase** → rewrites commits, creates linear history.

---

## 17. What is Git cherry-pick?

Apply specific commit from one branch to another.

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit_id>
```

---

## 18. Git pull vs Git fetch?

* **Fetch** → downloads commits only.
* **Pull** → fetch + merge into local branch.

---

## 19. I want to change the recent commit message. How?

```bash
git commit --amend -m "new message"
```

---

## 20. How to generate SSH keys and explain?

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

* Public key → add to GitHub.
* Private key → stays safe on local machine.
* Used for secure Git operations.

---

## 21. How are you merging code from one branch to another (PR)?

* Create Pull Request (PR) on GitHub.
* Reviewer checks code → Approves.
* Merge options:

  * **Merge commit** → preserves history.
  * **Squash merge** → compresses commits.
  * **Rebase merge** → linear history.
* Best practice: never push directly to `main`; always via PR.


Do you want me to also create a **ready-to-download `.md` file** so you can directly push it to your GitHub repo?
